# collegeApp1
It is a basic college login application integrated with mySQL database.
it has 2 types of users: admin and student. If you log in as admin you can add, edit and delete users. if you log in as a student, you can only view and edit your own profile. In the future, I will add guest and instructor accounts.
For my layout I used  scenebuilder. 
As of now, you can log in using the following credentials: 
username: 815175 password: 123456 - student 
username: 12345678 password: qwerty -admin
